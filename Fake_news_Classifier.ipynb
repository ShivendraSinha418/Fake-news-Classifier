These technologies enhance transparency, reduce risks, and improve efficiency, providing mid-sized developers with new funding opportunities. This transformation ensures better financial health assessments and efficient project management, fostering a more sustainable industry.\", 'The United States has been pushing allies including Japan and the Netherlands to toughen their restrictions on technology shipments to China, during visits to those countries as well as a Japanese state visit to Washington in April. Those nations are home to companies that produce chipmaking machinery, including ASML Holding NV and Tokyo Electron Limited.', 'The data analytics company will deploy its products, including the \"Gotham\" software - which assists in locating targets on battlefields - on Microsoft\\'s Azure Government and Azure Government Secret cloud platforms.', 'About seven years ago, the company had the chance to buy a stake in OpenAI, then a fledgling non-profit research organization working in a little-known field called generative artificial intelligence, four people with direct knowledge of those discussions told Reuters.', 'Rapid AI weather forecasts will also aid scientific discovery, said Amy McGovern, a professor of meteorology and computer science at the University of Oklahoma who directs an AI weather institute. She said weather sleuths now used AI to create thousands of subtle forecast variations that let them find unexpected factors that could drive such extreme events as tornadoes.', \"Microsoft revealed plans to boost investment in AI infrastructure despite a slowdown in cloud business growth, leading to a dip in shares. Capital expenditure rose to $19 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, mainly driven by AI and cloud projects. Azure's growth lagged behind estimates, though AI services significantly boosted revenue.\", \"Apple's AI features will not be included in the initial iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 releases in September. Instead, they will start rolling out in October. Developers will get early access for testing via iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 betas as early as this week. The features will be available on recent iPhone, iPad, and Mac models.\", 'AI firm C5i has acquired Analytic Edge, a marketing analytics company, its second acquisition in 12 months. While the companies did not disclose the size of the deal, sources told ET Analytic Edge was valued at $30-40 million after the transaction. US-based C5i is aiming for a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore in the coming fiscal year, its chairman said.', 'Prompt engineering is the process of structuring an instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. And now, top technology companies, including the likes of IBM, Accenture, and the Tata Group, are hunting for specialists who can speak the AI language.', 'Fears of overvalued Big Tech companies and unrealistic expectations for artificial intelligence are driving investors away from their former favourites, leading to a broad tech-led selloff in the market. Quarterly results from Tesla and Alphabet, the first of the bunch to report, have unnerved investors.', \"Chatbots such as Open AI's ChatGPT can write poetry, summarize books and answer questions, often with human-level fluency. These systems can do math, based on what they have learned, but the results can vary and be wrong. They are fine-tuned for determining probabilities, not doing rules-based calculations. Likelihood is not accuracy, and language is more flexible, and forgiving, than math.\", \"Elon Musk's social media poll asks if Tesla should invest $5 billion in xAI, his AI startup competing with OpenAI and Google. 70.2% of 322,000 users support it as of 0234 GMT. Tesla, reporting its lowest profit margin in 5 years, cut prices to boost demand. $10B AI expenditure includes Nvidia hardware. xAI raised $6 billion.\", \"This past week's global software outage, immediately proclaimed as the biggest in history, was not caused by terrorists or AI or rogue hackers demanding billions in ransom. It wasn't even done as a lark by some off-the-charts smart teenager. Those are the Hollywood versions. Instead, it was a routine upgrade that somehow went off the rails.\"]\n"
